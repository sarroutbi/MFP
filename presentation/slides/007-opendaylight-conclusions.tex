\frametitle{Conclusions And Future Work}

Conclussions:
\begin{itemize}
 \item MSWL applied to a particular FLOSS project, OpenDaylight in this case
 \item FLOSS/Open as best option to start collaborating around incipient technologies
 \item FLOSS as the most desirable option by customers
 \item FLOSS projects: better to be evaluated
\end{itemize}

Future Work:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Spread Any of the Knowledge in different OpenDaylight Open Source Project aspects
 \item Apply this study to a similar project in incipient technology (e.g.: OPNFV)
\end{itemize}
